The tower is also home to the world’s highest mosque situated on the 158th floor. The tripedal design and its projecting edges are a few of the features that helped the Burj Khalifa break all barriers. Adrian Smith, the architect of this giant, wishes to surpass the kilometer mark in form of the Kingdom Tower in Riyadh which is slated to open in 2017.">

The tower was built by Gustave Eiffel as the entrance arch for the International Exhibition of Paris of 1889. Standing tall at 300 meters, it then held the record for the world’s tallest building, until the Chrysler Building was erected in 1930. As of date, more than 2 billion people have paid the Eiffel Tower a visit, making it the most visited paid monument in the world. The observation deck at the top offers Parisians and visitors alike magnificent views of the snaking Seine and all the famous monuments lined on its bank.">

The Leaning Tower of Pisa, measuring only 56 meters, was built over a span of 177 years. In fact, the tower was left untouched for a century due to its poor foundation. Engineers had to build floors with one side higher than the other in order to compensate for the tilt.
